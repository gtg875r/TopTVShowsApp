# Android Project 4 - *Flixster 2: Top TV Shows*

Submitted by: **Aaron Fowler**

**Top TV Shows** is a movie browsing app that allows users to see what the top shows are based on popularity.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Choose any endpoint on The MovieDB API except `now_playing`**
  - Chosen Endpoint: `tv/popular`
- [X] **Make a request to your chosen endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.** 
- [ ] **Add rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**
- [ ] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**

## Notes

I struggled with re-working the poster images compared to how to accomplished this in the lab.  After a bit of trail and error, I ended up finding a solution that displayed the images.
I am not certain if it's the database itself, or something unique in my code, but the app takes a minute or so to load.  I'd be interested in learning if there's a way to cut-off how many tv shows are loading.
